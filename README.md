### Notes to grader:
*  Sometimes the transactions view has trouble painting to the view after a few launches - this is a known issue. Deleting and restarting the app removes this problem. Its a new bug - didnt happen until 8/31
*  Planned functionality for the final: Add/edit transactions, set spend categories, track rolling sum income and spend, log in/out, see how much each transaction is of the total monthly spend goal.  
* Push notifications required paid user account so that is nixed until I upgrade
* Coreplot required third party apps so I nixed that in order to focus on the other features
* Data is currently mocked/stored in the phones data dictionary, in a future release I will add a "New User Flow" to register new users and hook up the user data to an AppEngine server
* In the collection view, only Transactions is wired up right now
* The marketing and executive summary materials do not match current state functionality - they match future state functionality. Thank you!
